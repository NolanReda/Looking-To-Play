Looking To Play is a Counter Strike: Global Offensive(CS:GO) teammate findgin app for players who want to find more reliable teammates that random people in solo-que matchmaking. LTP allows players to create profiles including their ranks, region, time online and game stats to match with other players meeting similar criteria to play with.

I built LTP as a bit of a passion project. I've been playing CS on and off for over 17 years across 3 iderations of the game and one of the biggest problems I've dealt with is finding reliable friends to play with so I don't have to pray for luck jumping into solo-que matchmaking. So I decided to try and fix the issue.
